# Filesystem Corruption Issue

## Problem
The file `app.py` has become corrupted in the Windows filesystem and cannot be read, written, or deleted through normal means. VS Code shows the error:
```
Error: UNKNOWN: unknown error, stat 'd:\AI-OFFICIAL\app.py'
```

## Solution
The application has been saved as **`zeyta_app.py`** instead.

## How to Use
Run the application with:
```bash
python zeyta_app.py
```

## What's Inside zeyta_app.py
This file contains the complete, fixed version of the AI assistant application with:
- ✅ Minimal modern UI (ChatGPT/Gemini style)
- ✅ File upload with preview chips
- ✅ Voice input (Live Speech / Upload Audio modes)
- ✅ Proper LLM/STT/TTS initialization with CPU/GPU support
- ✅ Settings panel (Models/Pipeline/Voice Tools/System)
- ✅ Fixed scrolling and layout issues

## Filesystem Corruption Details
- Attempts to delete, move, or rename `app.py` result in errors
- Git operations on `app.py` fail with "Function not implemented"
- The corruption appears to be at the filesystem level (NTFS)

## Recommended Action
If you need to fix the filesystem:
1. Close VS Code and all applications
2. Run: `chkdsk D: /F` (requires admin and reboot)
3. After repair, you can rename `zeyta_app.py` back to `app.py` if desired

For now, simply use `zeyta_app.py` - it's identical to the intended `app.py` file.
