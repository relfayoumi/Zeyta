# Filesystem Corruption Issue - RESOLVED

## Original Problem
The file `app.py` had become corrupted in the Windows filesystem and could not be read, written, or deleted through normal means. VS Code showed the error:
```
Error: UNKNOWN: unknown error, stat 'd:\AI-OFFICIAL\app.py'
```

## Resolution
✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED** - The application has been successfully restored as `app.py`.

The corrupted version has been moved to `backups/app_restored.py` for reference.

## How to Use
Run the application with:
```bash
python app.py
```

## What's Inside app.py
This file contains the complete AI assistant application with:
- ✅ Minimal modern UI (ChatGPT/Gemini style)
- ✅ File upload with preview chips
- ✅ Voice input (Live Speech / Upload Audio modes)
- ✅ Proper LLM/STT/TTS initialization with CPU/GPU support
- ✅ Settings panel (Models/Pipeline/Voice Tools/System)
- ✅ Fixed scrolling and layout issues
