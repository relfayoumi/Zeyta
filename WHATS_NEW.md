# Zeyta AI Assistant - What's New

## New Python Application: `app.py`

We've created a brand new user-friendly Python application that runs in **its own standalone window**:
- üñ•Ô∏è Runs as a native desktop application (no browser needed!)
- üí¨ Chat with AI in a clean interface
- üìé Upload and discuss documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
- üîß Choose how you want to interact (text, voice, or both)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install for standalone window mode (recommended)
pip install pywebview

# Run the application
python app.py

# The app opens in its own window!

# Click "Initialize LLM" to start

# Start chatting!
```

## What Makes This Special?

### 0. Standalone Desktop Application
- Runs in its own window - no browser required
- Better compatibility across systems
- Native desktop application experience
- Automatically falls back to browser mode if pywebview not installed

### 1. Flexible Pipeline Configuration
Choose exactly which AI components you want to use:

| Mode | What It Does | Models Needed |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Text Chat Only** | Type ‚Üí AI responds with text | LLM |
| **Voice to Text** | Speak ‚Üí AI responds with text | STT + LLM |
| **Voice to Voice** | Speak ‚Üí AI responds with voice | STT + LLM + TTS |
| **Text to Voice** | Type ‚Üí AI responds with voice | LLM + TTS |

### 2. Document Upload & Analysis
Upload files and ask questions about them:
- Research papers (PDF)
- Code files (TXT)
- Documentation (MD)
- Reports (DOCX)

**Example:**
```
Upload: meeting_notes.pdf
Ask: "What are the action items?"
AI: Reads the document and extracts action items
```

### 3. Standalone Desktop Application
- Runs in its own window (not in browser)
- Native desktop application experience
- Better compatibility and performance
- Visual status indicators
- Helpful error messages
- Built-in quick guide

## How It Differs from Other Interfaces

### vs. `testing/integrated_app.py` (Testing Suite)
- ‚úÖ **app.py**: Daily use, document upload, flexible pipelines
- üîß **integrated_app.py**: Model testing, development, benchmarking

### vs. `main.py` (CLI Voice Assistant)
- ‚úÖ **app.py**: Visual interface, text chat, document upload
- üé§ **main.py**: Voice-only, command-line, simple

## New Documentation

We've created extensive documentation:

1. **APP_GUIDE.md** - Complete user guide
2. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - One-page quick start
3. **USAGE_EXAMPLES.md** - Real-world scenarios
4. **FEATURE_SHOWCASE.md** - Feature deep-dive
5. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical details
6. **INTERFACE_COMPARISON.md** - Compare all interfaces
7. **UI_MOCKUP.md** - Visual mockup
8. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - What was built

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Research Assistant
```
Upload: scientific_paper.pdf
Message: "Summarize the methodology and key findings"
Result: AI reads paper and provides structured summary
```

### 2. Code Review
```
Upload: app.py
Message: "Review this code and suggest improvements"
Result: AI analyzes code quality and provides feedback
```

### 3. Voice Conversation
```
Pipeline: Voice to Voice
Action: Speak your question
Result: Hear AI's voice response
```

### 4. Document Q&A
```
Upload: user_manual.pdf
Message: "How do I configure the settings?"
Result: AI finds and explains relevant sections
```

## Installation

### Basic (Text Chat)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### With Document Support
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install PyPDF2 python-docx
python app.py
```

### Full Features (Voice + Documents)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install PyPDF2 python-docx faster-whisper chatterbox-tts
python app.py
```

## System Requirements

**Minimum:**
- Python 3.11+
- 8GB RAM
