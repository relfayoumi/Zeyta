# Backups

This directory contains backup copies of files that have been replaced or superseded.

## Files

### app_restored.py
This is a backup copy of a corrupted version of `app.py` that had UTF-16 encoding issues. The file has been kept for reference purposes.

The current working version is `app.py` in the root directory.

**Note:** This file may have encoding issues and is kept only for historical reference. Use the main `app.py` instead.

## History
