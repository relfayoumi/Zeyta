   - Automatic text extraction from uploaded files
   - AI can read and understand document content
   - Answer questions about uploaded documents

3. **Pipeline Configuration**
   - Four switchable pipeline modes:
     - **Text Chat Only**: LLM only (fastest, text in/out)
     - **Voice to Text**: STT → LLM (voice in, text out)
     - **Voice to Voice**: STT → LLM → TTS (full voice conversation)
     - **Text to Voice**: LLM → TTS (text in, voice out)
   - Easy mode switching with radio buttons
   - Automatic routing based on selected pipeline

4. **Model Management**
   - On-demand model initialization
   - Support for three model types:
     - LLM (Language Model) - Required for all modes
     - STT (Speech-to-Text) - Optional, for voice input
     - TTS (Text-to-Speech) - Optional, for voice output
   - Status indicators for each model
   - Flexible model size selection (STT)
   - GPU/CPU device selection (TTS)

5. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Clean, intuitive layout
   - Organized sections (config, chat, settings, help)
   - Real-time status updates
   - Helpful error messages
   - Quick guide sidebar
   - System information display

6. **Adjustable Parameters**
   - Temperature slider (0.1-2.0) for response creativity
   - Max tokens slider (64-2048) for response length
   - Real-time parameter adjustment

```

### Code Organization

**app.py (~500 lines)**
- Input processing functions
- Model initialization functions
- File extraction utilities
- Main chat pipeline function
- Gradio UI creation
- Event handlers

### Key Functions

1. `extract_file_content(file_path)` - Extracts text from various file formats
2. `initialize_llm(model_id)` - Loads language model
3. `initialize_stt(model_size)` - Loads speech-to-text model
4. `initialize_tts(device)` - Loads text-to-speech model
5. `transcribe_audio(audio_file)` - Converts speech to text
6. `generate_speech(text)` - Converts text to speech
7. `chat_with_pipeline(...)` - Main chat logic with pipeline routing
8. `create_app()` - Builds Gradio interface

## Integration with Existing Code

The new application integrates seamlessly with existing Zeyta components:

- Uses existing `core/brain.py` pattern for LLM
- Compatible with existing `config.py` configuration
- Follows same model loading patterns
- Uses same dependencies
- Complements `testing/integrated_app.py` and `main.py`

## Requirements Updated

Added to `requirements.txt`:
```
PyPDF2          # PDF support
python-docx     # Word document support
```

## README Updates

Updated main README.md to include:
- New "AI Assistant Application" section
- Updated running instructions
- Link to APP_GUIDE.md
- Clear distinction between app.py and testing suite

## Validation

✅ All required functions present
✅ File extraction tests passed
✅ Documentation complete
✅ Integration validated

## User Experience

### Before (Issues):
- No single interface for all features
- Couldn't upload documents
- Fixed pipeline (all or nothing)
- Testing interface too technical

### After (Solutions):
- ✅ Single app.py for daily use
- ✅ Upload PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD files
- ✅ Choose pipeline components (text only, voice only, both)
- ✅ User-friendly interface
- ✅ Flexible configuration

## Usage Statistics

**Lines of Code:**
- app.py: ~500 lines
- tests/test_app.py: ~100 lines

**Documentation:**
- Total: ~40KB across 6 documents
- Covers all aspects from quick start to architecture

**File Formats Supported:**
- 4 document types (TXT, PDF, DOCX, MD)
- 1 audio type (for voice input)

**Pipeline Modes:**
- 4 different configurations

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

Potential improvements not implemented (to keep changes minimal):
- [ ] Image upload and analysis
- [ ] Multiple file upload at once
- [ ] Export conversation history
- [ ] Custom system prompts in UI
- [ ] Voice profile management
- [ ] Multi-language interface
- [ ] Conversation templates

## Issue Resolution

**Original Issue Requirements:**
> "Able to chat with the AI within a window, upload files, and configure desired pipeline (eg only stt+llm, etc)."

**Implementation:**
✅ Chat with AI within a window - Gradio web interface
✅ Upload files - Supports TXT, PDF, DOCX, MD
✅ Configure desired pipeline - 4 switchable modes (Text Only, Voice to Text, Voice to Voice, Text to Voice)

## Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive Python application that:
1. Provides a clean chat interface for AI interaction
2. Supports document upload and analysis
3. Offers flexible pipeline configuration
4. Includes extensive documentation
5. Maintains compatibility with existing codebase
6. Follows the principle of minimal changes while meeting all requirements

The application is production-ready and can be launched immediately with `python app.py`.
